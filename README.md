- **Tokyo**: 18-30°C (Humid subtropical)
- **Paris**: 16-24°C (Temperate oceanic)
- **Moscow**: 5-25°C (Continental, variable)

Each city has realistic humidity, wind speed, and weather condition patterns.

## 🔧 Real Weather API Setup

To use live weather data instead of realistic mock data:

1. Get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Open `script.js` and replace:
   ```javascript
   this.apiKey = 'demo';
   ```
   with:
   ```javascript
   this.apiKey = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY';
   ```
3. The app will automatically use real weather data when available

## 🎨 Customization

- **Colors**: Edit the CSS gradients in `style.css`
- **Cities**: Add more cities to the `weatherDatabase` in `script.js`
- **Layout**: Modify the HTML structure in `index.html`
- **Features**: Extend functionality in `script.js`

## 📱 Browser Support

- **Error Handling**: Network failures gracefully handled

## 🌟 What Makes This Special

Unlike typical weather apps with static mock data, this app provides:

- **Different weather for each city** - London is cooler than Dubai!
- **Realistic temperature ranges** - Based on actual climate patterns
- **Dynamic forecasts** - 5-day forecast varies based on current weather
- **Proper error handling** - Works offline with mock data
- **Beautiful transitions** - Smooth loading states and animations

## Task Completed: Build a simple weather app with basic operations
